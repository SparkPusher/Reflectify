# Reflectify
## A Setup for a Smart Mirror, based on Raspberry Pi Model 4B, Tkinter and Arduino
The intention was to build up a mirror and add the capability of taking pictures using a raspberry pi camera option as well as enable access to subprocesses like YouTube, SoundCloud, Spotify, and daily news. The project, however, was also not restricted to these options; there was an interest in making it user-friendly by adding a keyboard, speaker, and the ability to detect when someone is close enough to the mirror in order to show welcoming messages.
